Experiment - Dataset Generation (MasterKey,PlainText, CipherText, RoundKey) with Any Round for Neural CryptAnalysis

Instructions to use:
1. Place keys(files that contains keys) in the key_files folder.
2. Place plaintext (that has to be encrypted with the different keys) in the plaintext_files.
3. start terminal or command prompt (make sure working directory is same as the directory that contains codes and files).
4. run below command in terminal
python3 main.py

It will ask for which round you want to capture, enter round no.
5. After successfull execution of the program, you will get the outputs.
6. dataset-date-timestamp.csv file contains the data related to the ciphertext, plaintext, roundkey,  including bit values and lable.
7. time.txt contains information of execution time. [Uncomment Time related codes]

NOTE:
1. No need to configure anything.
2. Just run the code with the sample files already given. and see the ** MAGIC **
